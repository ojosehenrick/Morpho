# What I need to make Morpho work?
- AOSP, CAF or LOS rom are full compatible. OOS? IDK. MIUI? no.
- permissive SElinux

# How to tweak the profiles:
- the values that should change from SoC to SoC are represented by a "#"
- more values can be added with the command write or even setprop
- if you are in doubt, you can look at the 820/821 version, it's complete
